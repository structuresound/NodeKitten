# nodeKitten

nodeKitten is an experimental cross-platform openGL toolkit

It is designed to be light-weight and be embedded into a GL Context, rather than a windowing platform.

nodeKitten views come in a couple flavors so far

1. Cocoa
2. SDL
3. Emscripten (SDL)
4. JUCE

This library is under development, and is buggy as such, YMMV.

Roadmap is:
1. finish platform abstraction
2. document api
3. the fun stuff
